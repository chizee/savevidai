"""Manifest-driven mux endpoint: merge v.redd.it's split video+audio streams.

Reddit serves a DASH manifest whose video and audio tracks are separate byte
streams; a browser download of a single rendition therefore has no sound. This
endpoint reads the manifest (via ``reddit.fetch_manifest``), downloads the chosen
video rendition plus the audio track, and stream-copies them into one mp4 with
ffmpeg (``-c copy``: no re-encode, no quality loss, nothing transcoded). The
merge is ephemeral: both inputs and the output live in a per-request temp dir
that is deleted the instant the response finishes streaming.

Nothing is stored, no Reddit credentials are used (the byte fetch is anonymous
with the SaveVidAI UA), and the whole heavy path runs under a size-2 semaphore so
a small VPS is never asked to run more than two ffmpeg merges at once. When a clip
has no audio track the manifest carries no audio Representation, and we simply
307 the caller at the existing /api/proxy for the bare video rather than spinning
up ffmpeg for a no-op copy.
