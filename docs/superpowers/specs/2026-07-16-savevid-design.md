# SaveVid - Design Spec

Date: 2026-07-16
Status: Approved pending user review

## What

SaveVid is a public, open source Twitter/X video downloader. Paste a tweet URL, see a preview, pick a quality, download. No popups, no redirects, no fake download buttons, nothing between the user and the download.

## Goals

- Best-in-class UX for downloading Twitter/X videos and GIFs from a post URL.
- Near-zero running cost: server resolves links only, video bytes flow from Twitter's CDN to the user's browser.
- Open source (MIT), trivially self-hostable with one Docker command.
- Premium visual design: polished typography, purposeful animation, dark-first.
- Monetizable later with a single passive ad slot that never gates the download.

## Non-goals (v1)

- Instagram, TikTok, or any other platform (architecture stays platform-neutral for later).
- Accounts, history, or any server-side persistence.
- Private, age-restricted, or login-required tweets. Unsupported, stated honestly in the error message.
- Server-side conversion (real .gif export, trimming, format transcodes).
- Ad-gated or incentivized-click downloads. Never.

## Architecture

One repo, one Docker container. FastAPI serves the API and the built React frontend as static files. Identical artifact deploys to Render free tier (testing/staging) and a $5 VPS (production).

```
savevid/
  frontend/     Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind
  backend/      FastAPI + yt-dlp (Python 3.12)
  Dockerfile    multi-stage: build frontend, copy dist into backend image
  render.yaml   one-click Render deploy
  compose.yaml  VPS deploy (app + Caddy for HTTPS)
```

Extraction uses yt-dlp as a Python library in metadata-only mode (`skip_download`). It resolves a tweet URL to its mp4 variant URLs on video.twimg.com. The server never downloads video content in the normal path. When Twitter changes internals, the fix is a yt-dlp version bump.

## API

### POST /api/resolve

Request: `{ "url": "<tweet url>" }`

Accepts twitter.com, x.com, and mobile subdomain URLs. Response:

```json
{
  "id": "1234567890",
  "author": "Display Name",
  "handle": "username",
  "avatar_url": "...",
  "text": "tweet text",
  "thumbnail": "...",
  "duration_seconds": 42.5,
  "kind": "video",            // "video" | "gif"
  "variants": [
    { "label": "1080p", "width": 1920, "height": 1080, "url": "https://video.twimg.com/...", "size_bytes": 35651584 }
  ]
}
```

- Variants sorted best-first. `size_bytes` fetched via HEAD request server-side, null if unavailable.
- In-memory LRU cache, ~1 hour TTL, keyed by tweet ID. Popular tweets do not re-hit Twitter.
- Per-IP rate limit (10/min, slowapi) to protect the server's IP reputation with Twitter.
- Errors are structured: `{ "error": "not_found" | "no_video" | "private_or_restricted" | "invalid_url" | "rate_limited" | "upstream_error", "message": "human text" }` with appropriate HTTP status.

### GET /api/proxy?url=...

Streaming fallback for the rare case browser-side CORS download fails. Hard-restricted to `https://video.twimg.com/` URLs (reject anything else with 403) so the server cannot be used as an open proxy. Same per-IP rate limit. Sets `Content-Disposition` with the clean filename.

## Download mechanics

Browsers ignore the `download` attribute cross-origin, so a plain CDN link would play the video in a tab instead of saving. Primary path: frontend fetches the mp4 from video.twimg.com as a blob (their CDN sends permissive CORS), shows real progress from the response stream, saves via object URL with filename `{handle}_{tweetid}_{label}.mp4`. Fallback path: if the blob fetch fails (CORS regression, odd browser), the download button retries via `/api/proxy` transparently.

## Frontend UX

Single page, whole flow on one screen, zero navigation.

1. Hero: brand, one-line promise ("Twitter videos. One paste. No garbage."), large paste input.
2. Paste: auto-reads clipboard on input focus (permission-gated), Ctrl/Cmd+V anywhere on the page triggers resolve, URL in `?url=` query param resolves on load (enables browser bookmarklets/share targets later).
3. Resolving: skeleton preview card, subtle shimmer. Typical wait 1-2 s.
4. Preview card: thumbnail with duration badge, author avatar + name + handle, tweet text (clamped), GIF badge when `kind == "gif"`.
5. Quality row: one button per variant, label + size ("1080p · 34 MB"), best quality visually primary. Click starts blob download with an animated progress bar in the button itself; completed state confirms saved filename.
6. Errors: inline under the input, specific and honest per error code, never a bare "something went wrong" when we know more.
7. Footer: GitHub link, "Support this project" (Ko-fi/GitHub Sponsors), privacy line ("No ads, no tracking, no cookies. Open source.").

### Design language

- Typography: Geist Sans (UI) + Geist Mono (resolutions, sizes, progress numbers). Both open-license, self-hosted, no third-party font CDN.
- Dark-first with light mode toggle, one restrained accent color, generous whitespace.
- Animation is purposeful and premium: hover states with subtle lift/glow on all interactive elements, smooth transitions between states (input, skeleton, card reveal, per-button progress), micro-interactions on copy/paste. GPU-friendly transforms only; `prefers-reduced-motion` fully respected.
- No ads, no analytics, no cookies in v1, and the page says so.

## Monetization (future, designed now)

- Brand promise: "no popups, no redirects, no fake buttons - ever" (not "ad-free forever").
- One `<AdSlot>` component in the layout, feature-flagged via env var, off by default. Self-host builds stay clean.
- When traffic justifies (~1k+ daily visitors): EthicalAds/Carbon-style single text ad or one flat-rate direct sponsor. Never AdSense (downloader sites get banned), never popunder/incentivized networks, never anything that gates or delays a download.
- Donations from day one via footer link.

## Error handling

| Case | Detection | User message |
|---|---|---|
| Not a tweet URL | URL parse | "That doesn't look like a Twitter/X post link." |
| Tweet deleted/404 | yt-dlp error class | "This post doesn't exist or was deleted." |
| No video in tweet | yt-dlp result | "This post has no video. Photos aren't supported yet." |
| Private/restricted | yt-dlp error class | "This post is private or age-restricted. SaveVid only works with public posts." |
| Twitter rate-limits us | yt-dlp error class | "Twitter is rate-limiting right now. Try again in a minute." |
| Unknown yt-dlp failure | catch-all | "Extraction failed. If this keeps happening, report it on GitHub." + server-side log |

All upstream failures logged with tweet ID and yt-dlp error so breakage from Twitter-side changes is visible immediately.

## Open source setup

- MIT license, README with screenshots, self-host one-liner (`docker run -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/<owner>/savevid`, image published from the repo's CI), Deploy-to-Render button.
- GitHub Actions: lint (ruff, eslint), backend tests, frontend build, Docker image publish to GHCR on tag.
- CONTRIBUTING note: extraction breakages usually mean "bump yt-dlp," documented so contributors can self-serve.

## Testing

- Backend unit tests (yt-dlp mocked): URL parsing/normalization for all tweet URL shapes, variant sorting and labeling, cache behavior, rate limiting, proxy domain lock (must reject non-twimg URLs), error mapping.
- Frontend: component tests for the state machine (idle → resolving → card → downloading → done → error).
- One live smoke test against a known stable tweet, manual or scheduled, excluded from CI (depends on Twitter uptime).

## Deployment

- Staging: Render free tier via render.yaml. Known cold-start (~30-60 s after idle); acceptable for testing only.
- Production: $5 VPS (Hetzner CX22 or similar), compose.yaml runs app container + Caddy with automatic HTTPS. Watchtower optional for auto-updating yt-dlp patch releases.
- Domain: savevid.app or similar, purchased later; site functions on free subdomain meanwhile.

## Risks

- Twitter breaks extraction: highest-likelihood risk. Mitigation: yt-dlp dependency, version bump releases, CI badge showing live smoke test status.
- Server IP gets rate-limited by Twitter at scale: mitigation is the cache + per-IP limits; if it ever happens anyway, escape hatch is rotating the VPS IP or adding a second cheap VPS.
- CDN CORS behavior changes: proxy fallback already designed in.
- Trademark: name avoids "Twitter"/"Tweet"/"X" marks; site copy says "for Twitter/X" descriptively, which is standard nominative use.
