# SaveVid AI: VPS migration runbook

Move off Render (metered egress + free-tier spin-down) onto a single VPS with
included bandwidth. SaveVid proxies video bytes through the server, so bandwidth
scales with downloads. A VPS with included traffic is the right home for that;
metered clouds are not.

All state lives in **Turso (remote)**, so there is nothing to migrate. The VPS
is stateless apart from Caddy's TLS cert (kept in a Docker volume). Rollback is
just repointing DNS back at Render.

---

## 1. Which VPS ($5/mo class)

**Pick: Hetzner Cloud CX22.** For a video proxy, included bandwidth is the whole
game, and Hetzner gives ~50x what the mainstream clouds do at this price.

| Provider | Plan | vCPU / RAM | Included traffic | ~Price/mo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hetzner (recommended)** | **CX22** (x86) | 2 / 4 GB | **20 TB** | ~4.30 EUR (~$4.70, incl. IPv4) |
| Hetzner (cheaper, ARM) | CAX11 | 2 / 4 GB | 20 TB | ~4.00 EUR |
| Netcup | VPS 1000 ARM G11 | 4 / 8 GB | "unlimited" (fair use) | ~$5 |
| Contabo | VPS S | 4 / 8 GB | 32 TB | ~$5-6 |
| DigitalOcean / Vultr / Linode | Basic | 1 / 1-2 GB | **1-2 TB only** | $6 |

Notes:
- **20 TB vs your ~0.6 TB/month now** = 30x headroom, so bandwidth stops being a
  cost or an outage cause.
- **Avoid DO/Vultr/Linode for this workload:** only 1-2 TB included, then
  ~$0.01/GB overage. You would blow past 1 TB in days at current traffic.
- **Region:** your #1 country is Spain and traffic is EU-heavy, so pick a
  Hetzner **EU** location (Falkenstein / Nuremberg / Helsinki) for best latency.
  Ashburn/Hillsboro if you expect to skew US later.
- **x86 (CX22) vs ARM (CAX11):** the Docker image currently builds for x86, so
  CX22 is the no-surprises pick. CAX11 (ARM) also works since the box builds from
  source, but stick with CX22 unless you want to save ~0.30 EUR.
- Choose **Ubuntu 24.04** as the image.

---

## 2. Cutover steps (about 15 minutes)

### a. Create the box
- Hetzner Cloud console: new CX22, Ubuntu 24.04, EU region, add your SSH key.
- Note its public IPv4.
- (Optional) Cloud Firewall or `ufw`: allow **22, 80, 443** inbound.

### b. Bootstrap it
SSH in as root and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OxIsrafil/savevidai/main/deploy/setup-vps.sh | bash
```

First run creates `/opt/savevidai/deploy/app.env` and stops. Fill it in with the
**same values you already have in Render** (Environment tab: the 4 analytics
vars), then re-run:

```bash
nano /opt/savevidai/deploy/app.env
bash /opt/savevidai/deploy/setup-vps.sh
```

It builds the current `main` and starts the app + Caddy.

### c. Test BEFORE touching DNS
From your laptop, prove the box serves the app, bypassing DNS:

```bash
curl -sk --resolve savevidai.israfill.dev:443:<VPS_IP> https://savevidai.israfill.dev/api/health
```

Expect `{"status":"ok"}` (or a 200). If Caddy has not issued a cert yet because
DNS is not live, test the origin directly first: `curl -s http://<VPS_IP>/api/health`
will 404 at Caddy (host mismatch) which still proves Caddy is up.

### d. Flip DNS (Cloudflare)
- Cloudflare dashboard, israfill.dev zone, DNS records.
- Edit the `savevidai` record: point it to the **VPS IP** (A record).
- Keep it **DNS-only (grey cloud), NOT proxied.** Two reasons: Caddy needs to
  reach Let's Encrypt directly for the cert, and Cloudflare's free proxy is not
  for serving large volumes of video (their ToS), which is exactly your traffic.
- TTL: set low (e.g. 60s) a few minutes before cutover so it propagates fast.

Within a minute or two Caddy issues the cert and the site is live from the VPS.
Watch it:

```bash
docker compose -f /opt/savevidai/compose.prod.yaml logs -f caddy   # cert issuance
docker compose -f /opt/savevidai/compose.prod.yaml logs -f app     # requests
curl -si https://savevidai.israfill.dev/api/health
```

### e. Point UptimeRobot at the new box
No change needed if it monitors the hostname. Keep the 5-minute /api/health
ping.

### f. Decommission Render
Once the VPS is serving cleanly for a few hours: in Render, **suspend** (do not
delete yet) the `savevidai` service so you can roll back instantly if needed.
Delete after a day of stable VPS operation.

---

## 3. Rollback (instant)

If anything goes wrong, repoint the Cloudflare `savevidai` A record back to
Render's target (or re-enable the Render service). DNS-only means the switch is
just the record value. No data is lost either way (Turso is shared).

---

## 4. Day-to-day after the move

Auto-deploy is off on Render and there is no CI deploy to the VPS, so you deploy
on purpose:

```bash
ssh root@<VPS_IP>
cd /opt/savevidai
git pull
docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml up -d --build
```

- **Maintenance mode:** the in-dashboard admin toggle still works (it is an
  in-memory flag; a container restart clears it to Live, same as before). The
  `MAINTENANCE_MODE` env var in `deploy/app.env` is the hard-override backup.
- **Logs:** `docker compose -f compose.prod.yaml logs -f app`.
- **Bandwidth:** check the Hetzner console traffic graph. At ~0.6 TB/month you
  have ~30x headroom on the 20 TB allowance.
- **Updating this box from a new release:** just `git pull` + the up command
  above. It rebuilds from source, so it always runs current `main`.

---

## 5. What did NOT change

- Turso analytics DB, admin dashboard, ADMIN_PASSWORD, ANALYTICS_SALT: identical.
- The app, Dockerfile, Caddyfile: unchanged. `compose.prod.yaml` just adds the
  env file and builds from source instead of pulling the stale GHCR image.
- Downloads still proxy through the server. The point of the move is that a VPS
  includes the bandwidth to do that at viral scale; Render meters it.
